# NightRidyder

NightRidyder is a personal AI-powered assistant for code review and issue management, designed to work while you sleep.

## Overview

NightRidyder is a specialized tool that activates during your off-hours to help manage your GitHub repositories. It focuses on:

1. Reviewing pull requests you've left overnight
2. Suggesting new issues based on code analysis
3. Providing insights on code health, test suites, and pipeline failures

## Key Features

- **Nocturnal PR Review**: Automatically reviews PRs assigned to you or tagged with a specific label during your inactive hours.
- **Code Health Analysis**: Runs comprehensive checks on your codebase to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.
- **Test Suite Evaluation**: Analyzes your test coverage and suggests improvements.
- **Pipeline Failure Insights**: Investigates CI/CD pipeline failures and provides potential solutions.
- **Issue Generation**: Creates detailed, actionable issues based on its analysis.

## Goals

1. Implement a system to detect when you're inactive (e.g., sleeping) and activate NightRidyder.
2. Develop a robust PR review mechanism that adheres to your coding standards and best practices.
3. Create a code analysis tool that can identify code smells, potential bugs, and areas for optimization.
4. Design a test suite analyzer to evaluate test coverage and suggest new test cases.
5. Build a CI/CD pipeline analyzer to provide insights on failures and suggest fixes.
6. Implement an issue creation system that generates well-structured, informative GitHub issues.
7. Ensure all operations are secure and respect repository permissions.
8. Develop a simple interface for you to review NightRidyder's actions and suggestions when you return to work.

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
  - Reasoning: TypeScript provides static typing, enhancing code quality and developer experience. It's excellent for large-scale applications and offers great tooling support.
- **Runtime**: Node.js
  - Reasoning: Provides a robust environment for running TypeScript on the server-side.
- **GitHub API**: For interacting with repositories, PRs, and issues.
  - We'll use the `@octokit/rest` library, which has excellent TypeScript support.
- **Static Code Analysis**: Tools like ESLint with TypeScript plugins for code health analysis.
- **AI/ML**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT or similar models for intelligent analysis and suggestion generation.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Hooks into popular CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.
